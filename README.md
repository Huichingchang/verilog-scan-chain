# Verilog Scan Chain Project

This project implements a **3-stage scan chain** using Verilog HDL.  
It includes RTL design, testbench for simulation, and waveform verification.

``` 
===== Scan Chain Simulation Result =====

- Time: 0ns  
  ➔ Reset active (rst_n = 0)

- Time: 10ns  
  ➔ Reset released (rst_n = 1)

- Time: 20ns  
  ➔ Scan mode enabled (scan_en = 1)

- Time: 20ns  
  ➔ Scan_in = 1 shifted in

- Time: 30ns  
  ➔ Scan_in = 0 shifted in

- Time: 40ns  
  ➔ Scan_in = 1 shifted in

- Time: 50ns  
  ➔ Scan_in = 1 shifted in

- Time: 60ns  
  ➔ Scan mode disabled (scan_en = 0)

Final output:

- q[2:0] = 3'b110
- scan_out = 1
